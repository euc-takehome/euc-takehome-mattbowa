# Eucalyptus Coding Exercise

Congratulations on being selected for our coding exercise! You're reading this because we see potential in you and we're excited to see more of your technical side.

This coding exercise is a real challenge that we've encountered at Eucalyptus, and one we hope will give you the opportunity to demonstrate how you approach and tackle software problems.

We'd love to have your submission within the next 7 days, but please reach out if other commitments prevent this.

Overall, we expect that this will take you 2-3 hours, and we'd prefer you to not spend more time than this. If you're running close to three hours, we would suggest ensuring the code is in a runnable state and then documenting what additional changes you would have made if you had more time.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Git
- Node
- Yarn or npm

### Running the app

```
npm i && npm run start
```

### Running the tests

```
npm i && npm run test
```

## Context

At Eucalyptus we gather information from our patients in the form of answers to questionnaires. Often a patient will answer multiple questionnaires over their time with Eucalyptus, with overlap in the questions asked.

Recently engineers within Eucalyptus have expressed that they have found it complicated to utilise this data in its current format, and so we're looking at providing a simplified interface.

### Data Model

![](./db_schema.svg)

## Requirements

- Design a REST or GraphQL API that allows retrieving the following properties for a patient:
  - Date of birth
  - First name
  - Last name
  - Allergies
  - Medications
- Integrate the API with the SQLite database in `./questionnaire.db`
- Handle multiple answers from the same patient for the same question on different dates
  - This requirement is purposefully vague, as we are curious to see how you approach this task, and what assumptions you choose to make

## Tips

We'll be looking for:

- A well-defined and extensible API schema.
- A well-designed and secure implementation.
- Production quality code.
- Clearly communicated assumptions.
- Useful and well structured tests.
- A functionally correct solution (we'll be running some tests using the sample data).

## Submission

Well done!

1. Please push your changes up to the repository.
2. Send us an email to let us know you're done.
3. A couple of Eucalyptus engineers will perform a detailed review of your submission. We'll get back in touch when we're done.

Thanks!
